            The Nissan GT-R is a sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan, unveiled in 2007.
            [3][4][5] It is the successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline.
             Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up.
              The GT-R is built on the PM platform, which is derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and the Nissan Z models.
             After more than six years of development, the production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show
              and featured the VR38DETT engine and other new technologies.

        <p class="carPara" id="car2Para">
            The Toyota Supra is a sports car and 
            grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978.
             The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".[3]
             The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since
              March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both 
              longer and wider.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the 
              prefix Celica and named the car Supra.

              The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout.
               The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine.
                Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A". Along with this name, 
                Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra.
                 It was derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange

                  Mercedes-Benz cars are an important part of the history of the car with many "firsts‚Äù.
                  They were the first to build a diesel-powered car in the 1930s, 
                  the first to build a car with fuel injection in the 1950s and the first to offer antilock brakes in the 1970s.
                  Mercedes-Benz cars have also been important in auto racing history.
